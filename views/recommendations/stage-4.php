            <li>In the event that a consumer calls to negotiate, offer concessions right away, before they have a chance to strongly consider alternate options.</li>
            <li>Embrace gravitation towards cord cutting by helping them experiment with alternative options that would still allow them to stay inside the Dish ecosystem. Explore potential partnerships with OTT providers that could help make this possible.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, consider surfacing the irritations and inconveniences of cutting the cord and / or highlighting the value of extra channels (discovery).</li>
